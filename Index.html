Author's note:  I just wanted to state that I had the last few days off of work, and
decided to dedicate most of my time to my classes, which is why this is being turned in pretty early.
That being said, I had a blast making this website, and I learned a ton in the process.

            <p>I am a 23 year old student at STI.  I am currently studying to get an associates in Computer Programming.  I am very new to the field, so I am not entirely sure what area of programming will be best suited for me; but I am having tons of fun learning HTML, CSS, and C# so far.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Ideally, this page will end up displaying my projects and work, so hopefully we will see this more full in the future.</p>

            <p> I currently work at a warehouse, filled with menial and repetitive tasks.  Listening to audio books while I am working has been an amazing way to cope with the monotony.  I have around 1800 hours on audible, and most of that was at work!   My recommendation for anyone into fantasy is the “Malazan: Book of the Fallen” series by Steven Erickson</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also love video games, and have been playing them off an on since I was a kid;  I have put 100s of hours into all kinds of games, and I love discussing them and learning what other people like to play. </p>
